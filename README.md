# Introduction to SVG Output with D3

D3 is capable of creating regular DOM elements like divs and buttons, and can even render to canvas, but by far the most common type of output is SVG. In this lesson weâ€™ll convert from DOM elements to SVG elements, and make the updates necessary for maintaining a consistent appearance between the two.
